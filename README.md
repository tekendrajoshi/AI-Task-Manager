# AI-Task-Manager

lets do step by step first tell me the columns that should be in the user table(it should store the data that google provides with continue with google option while login)  for both the table users and the ai_task_manager the user id column will be the one provided by the google itself for those who dont login with google it will be auto generated right?



 ok my n8n autiomation is now working and i am able to store tasks now is to make a complete webapp that has one webpage as the dashboard another as the chatting with thhe ai agent section (similar to chatgpts one) and another page where the tasks stored in the sql database(railways i.e. is remotely stored hopw we can extract datas from that too) are fetched and then presented in the webpage with three sections one for completed works another for pending and another for not started ones i.e. classified based on the status or we can aso give user to view the tasks onto did=ff sections classified based priority too. there should be notification system to i.e. the app should notify the user about its pending works time and again and notify about the deadlines.
