## Overview

As students, we often brainstorm ideas with ChatGPT or similar AI tools and create mindmaps—but remembering everything or manually summarizing discussions into notes is difficult and inefficient.  

The **AI Task Manager** automates this process: you can discuss with the AI agent, receive feedback, and directly add tasks with a single prompt. Tasks are organized efficiently with status tracking and priority management.
